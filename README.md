# simple-login-form-react-native
This repository gives an overview how we can implement simple login page with navigation on the basis of success or failure. Here I am using react-native-elements package for
making the form and react-navigation package for navigation between the pages. In my example, If you enter the same string in password field
which is entered in the email-id field. Only then you can go the success page otherwise it go the failure page. I also add the functionality
of hiding and showing the password.
